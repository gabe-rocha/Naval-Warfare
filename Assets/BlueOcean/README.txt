1, Resolution of FFT on GPU support 3 levels, 256, 512 and 1024. 
The smaller the resolution, the better the performance, on the contrary, the higher the detail

2, More lod layer you can see further wave, too many layers may cause intense scattering(the ocean color is brighter).
You can adjust the "Subsurface Scattering" parameters of the material to get the effect you want

3, You also can turn off screen-space reflection for better performance
